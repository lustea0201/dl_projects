# Simple Deep Learning Framework

## Content

- module.py: our framework

- utils.py: utility functions used for training and generating our toy dataset

- test.py: simple working example illustrating how to use our framework. Can be used by running 

  `python test.py`

  in a terminal (executes in roughly 10 seconds in the course VM)
  
 - comparison.py: reproduce our comparison of the different losses, activations and initializations. Can be used by running 

  `python comparison.py`

  in a terminal (executes in roughly 30 minutes in the course VM)

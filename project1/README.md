# Neural Network Architectures for Digit Comparison
## Content

- models: our different networks and auxilary network
- utils.py: utility functions used for training and generating the error rates
- dlc_practical_prologue.py:  provided functions that generate the data sets
- test.py: example illustrating how to use our different models. Can be used by running

  `python test.py`
  in a terminal (takes roughly 10 mins in the course VM <sup>1</sup>)
  
- predict.py: sample example executing the best network of our model. Can be used by running

  `python predict.py`
  in a terminal (takes roughly 1 min in the course VM <sup>1</sup>)

# Neural Network Architectures for Digit Comparison
## Content

- models: our different networks and auxilary network
- utils.py: utility functions used for training and generating the error rates
- dlc_practical_prologue.py:  provided functions that generate the data sets
- test.py: example illustrating how to use our different models. Can be used by running

  `python test.py`
  in a terminal
  
- predict.py: sample example executing the best network of our model. Can be used by running

  `python predict.py`
  in a terminal

  
  WARNING: the exection of "test.py" the may take a few minutes, please run "predict.py" for a faster result.
